# Approching the Test
By solving this test I face some difficulties not only with the data itself but also with the way of solving like different scenarios impacting the solution

## Drive through Approching

* Set the libraries and the connection to the data then ensure the record data and fields match so we can get down to work!
* Analyze the fields for each table to get more used to the data and read the question one by one

## Detail Questions

* SQL : Which artist in this data set lived the longest? 
  * 
* SQL : Who are the top 10 artists by the number of artworks?
* SQL Which artist is created the most artwork by total surface area?
* SQL : Did any artists have artwork acquired during their lifetime?
* Please review the quality of the data, and present any issues
* SQL : Please group the artworks into as many clusters as you feel is appropriate, using attributes from both the artist and artworks tables, and assign each artwork to this new cluster.
